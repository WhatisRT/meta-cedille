* Meta Cedille
This is the reference implementation for a version of cedille that supports metaprogramming. The [[https://github.com/WhatisRT/meta-cedille/wiki][wiki]] and [[https://whatisrt.github.io/][blog]] contain some information and documentation.
* Building
- Manually
=Agda 2.6.2=, the Agda standard library (version 1.7) and =bytestring-trie= (the Haskell library) are required. If those are setup correctly, just use the makefile. If you are using =stack=, you can also try =make stack= (this will not install Agda and the Agda standard library for you though).
- Using Nix
If you use =nix=, simply use =nix-build=.
* Running the current tests/examples
The file =test/Test.mced= contains the current tests. Run =./meta-cedille --load test/Test= to execute all current tests. Alternatively, run =run_tests.sh= (which doesn't spawn a repl).
