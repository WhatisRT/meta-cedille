* Meta Cedille
This is the reference implementation for a version of cedille that supports metaprogramming. The [[https://github.com/WhatisRT/meta-cedille/wiki][wiki]] and [[https://whatisrt.github.io/][blog]] contain some information and documentation.
* Building
=Agda 2.6.1=, the Agda standard library (version 1.3) and =bytestring-trie= (the Haskell library) are required. If those are setup correctly, just use the makefile.
* Testing
The file =test/Test.mced= contains the current tests. Run =./meta-cedille --load test/Test= to execute all current tests. Alternatively, run =run_tests.sh= (which doesn't spawn a repl).
