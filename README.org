* Meta Cedille
This is the reference implementation for a version of cedille that supports metaprogramming.
* Building
`Agda 2.6` and the agda standard library are required. If those are setup correctly, just use the makefile.
* Testing
The file `TestFiles/Test.mced` contains the current tests. Run `meta-cedille` and execute the command `import TestFiles/Test.mced.`. If there is no error, the test was successful.
