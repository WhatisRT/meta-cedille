* Meta Cedille
This is the reference implementation for a version of cedille that supports metaprogramming. The [[https://github.com/WhatisRT/meta-cedille/wiki][wiki]] and [[https://whatisrt.github.io/][blog]] contain some information and documentation.
* Building
`Agda 2.6.1` and the agda standard library (version 1.3) are required. If those are setup correctly, just use the makefile.
* Testing
The file `test/Test.mced` contains the current tests. Run `./meta-cedille --load test/Test` to execute all current tests. Alternatively, run `run_tests.sh` (which doesn't spawn a repl).
